# thesis-project - Study of evaluation metrics while predicting the yield of lettuce plants in indoor farms using machine learning models


Predicting the yield of lettuce plants is essential for farmers to optimize their crop production and increase their overall yield. Different parameters affect the growth of lettuce plants, such as climatic conditions, water nutrients, and other environmental factors. In our project, different scenarios with different input variables were used and these data are fed into the models to understand the features affecting lettuce growth.
